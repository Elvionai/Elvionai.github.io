                Good day honorable chairman, dearest principal, esteemed panel of judges, trusted timekeeper, my co-debaters and my fellow students. My name is El-rohi Babalola and I am here to support the motion that says technology in the classroom is more of a distraction than a tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                Firstly, if technology was used by students in school nobody would ever pass <span class="strike">in</span> their examination because <span class="correction" data-fix="the"></span> majority of them would be distracted by their devices as they will either play games or just watch videos and take photos of themselves. The teachers may not be able to stop them because they might quickly change their video and act innocent <span class="correction strike" data-fix="making">making</span> the teachers <span class="strike">to</span> notice nothing.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="correction strike" data-fix="Furthermore,">In addition to</span> parents would take their children out of school and students may start being home schooled<span class="teacher-ink">,</span> ruining friendship for children which can make them emotionally unstable which is very bad. Parents may go as far as <span class="correction strike" data-fix="suing">Sueing</span> the school and asking for their money back<span class="teacher-ink">;</span> this could even cause quarrel and conflict between adults and children.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="correction strike" data-fix="Consequently,">In condition,</span> teaching would no longer be a useful job as nobody will get money, and no one learns anything meaning no profit. Also, if this continues in the future <span class="strike">mad people and brainless people</span> would own the world.
                <span class="comment">Language choice: "Uneducated" is better.</span>
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, I hope I have been able to prove to you that technology in school has very terrible consequences.
            </p>

                THANK YOU

                Teacher's Note: Strong passion and clear arguments, El-rohi! Watch your transitional phrases and avoid overly informal insults. Great effort!
