        <p class="salutation">Good day honorable chairman, dearest principal, esteemed panel of judges, trusted timekeeper, my co-debaters, and my fellow students,</p>
        <p>My name is El-Rohi Babalola, and I am here to support the motion that technology in the classroom is more of a distraction than a tool.</p>

        <p>Firstly, if technology were widely used by students in school, academic performance could suffer significantly. A large number of students would likely be distracted by their devices, as they would either play games, watch videos, or take photos of themselves. Teachers might find it challenging to monitor and intervene effectively, as students could quickly switch applications and feign innocence, making detection difficult.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, such widespread distraction could lead parents to withdraw their children from traditional schooling, opting for homeschooling instead. This shift could potentially hinder the development of crucial social skills and friendships for children, which is vital for emotional stability. Parents might even consider legal action against schools, seeking refunds, which could cause considerable tension and conflict within the community.</p>

        <p>Consequently, teaching might cease to be a viable profession. If no meaningful learning occurs, the value of education diminishes, and teachers might struggle to earn a living. Ultimately, this scenario could lead to a future where individuals lacking critical thinking and intellectual development become prevalent, negatively impacting society as a whole.</p>

        <p class="closing">In conclusion, I hope I have been able to demonstrate to you that integrating technology into the classroom without strict controls can have significant negative consequences.</p>

        <p class="closing">THANK YOU</p>
        <p class="closing">Sincerely,</p>
        <p class="closing">El-Rohi Babalola</p>
