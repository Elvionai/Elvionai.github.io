            <h1>Debate: Technology in the Classroom</h1>
            <p>By: El-rohi Babalola</p>
        </div>

        <div class="speech-body">
            <p class="salutation">
                Good day honorable chairman, dearest principal, esteemed panel of judges, trusted timekeeper, my co-debaters, and my fellow students. My name is El-rohi Babalola, and I am here to support the motion that says technology in the classroom is more of a distraction than a tool.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Firstly,</strong> if technology was used by students in school, their academic performance could significantly decline because the majority of them would be distracted by their devices. They might play games, watch videos, or take photos of themselves. Teachers may not be able to stop them, as students could quickly switch their screens and act innocent, making it difficult for teachers to notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In addition,</strong> widespread technology use could lead to parental concerns. If parents feel their children are not learning effectively, they might consider options like homeschooling. This could disrupt the social development of children, potentially impacting their emotional stability. This friction could even cause conflict between parents and the school administration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Furthermore,</strong> an over-reliance on technology might devalue the essential role of a teacher. If learning becomes entirely automated, the human connection in education is lost, and students may not develop critical thinking skills. If this trend continues, it could lead to a future generation less capable of innovation and deep thought.
            </p>
            <p class="conclusion">
                In conclusion, I hope I have been able to prove to you that technology in school, if not carefully managed, has very terrible consequences.
            </p>
            <p class="thank-you">
                THANK YOU.

            <h3>Teacher's Comments:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Excellent Opening:</strong> Your salutation is confident and respectful. A very strong start!</li>
                <li><strong>Strong Main Point:</strong> Your first point about distraction is clear and very relevant. Well argued.</li>
                <li><strong>Suggestions for Improvement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Avoid exaggerations like "nobody would ever pass." Instead, use phrases like "it could significantly harm exam results," which is more persuasive.</li>
                        <li>Your points about homeschooling and "brainless people" are a bit extreme. Try to keep your arguments focused on more immediate and provable consequences to make your case even stronger.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Overall:</strong> A passionate and well-structured argument. With a few refinements to the supporting points, this would be a near-perfect speech. Great job, El Rohi!</li>
